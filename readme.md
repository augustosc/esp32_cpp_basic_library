# Esp32 Cpp Library
## Objective
My main objective is to study, learn and understand the ESP32 chip 
and its features, improve knowledge of C++ and Espressif SDK ESP-IDF.

At the same time, develop a base very basic library, in C++, 
to use in others DIY projects  with ESP32.


## Reference
This Esp32 base project is based on Simon Howroyd project.
You can find it in: https://github.com/howroyd/esp32_youtube_series/tree/main;
and: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowIV8ZSSsAXRAsxyKArbY4EEqvUnYNtn

I also used some techniques and codes learned in Mair Swartz's great course that you can find here https://learnesp32.com. Thank you Mair.


The structure proposed by Howroyd seemed very interesting to me, 
as it provides the use of C++ and Object Oriented Programming, 
allowing the subdivision of projects into classes that can be widely used. 

Thanks to Mr. Howroyd and Mr. Swartz.
